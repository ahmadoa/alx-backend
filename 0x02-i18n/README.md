Internationalization and Localization are two essential concepts in software development, commonly abbreviated as I18n and L10n. These concepts deal with making software applications adaptable to different languages, regions, and cultures to ensure a more accessible and user-friendly experience for people worldwide.

1. Internationalization (I18n): Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software in a way that makes it easily adaptable to different languages, regions, and cultures without changing the underlying codebase. The goal is to create a base application that remains the same across different locales, allowing for easy translation and adaptation.

1. Localization (L10n): Localization is the process of adapting a software application or content to a specific locale or target audience. It involves translating user interface elements, date and time formats, number formats, and other content to suit the cultural and language preferences of the target region.
